1️⃣ What is Branching and Merging?


Branching = Creating a separate copy of your code to work on a new feature or fix without affecting the main code.


Example: You create a feature-login branch to work on login functionality.




Merging = Bringing your changes from that branch back into the main code (like main branch) after testing and reviewing.



💻 2️⃣ Do it Using Git Commands (on your system)
Step 1: Check current branch
git branch

This shows which branch you’re currently on (the active one has a * before it).

Step 2: Create a new branch
git branch feature-login

✅ Creates a branch named feature-login.

Step 3: Switch to the new branch
git checkout feature-login

Now you’re working on that branch. (Alternatively: git switch feature-login)

Step 4: Make changes and commit
Edit your files → then:
git add .
git commit -m "Added login feature"


Step 5: Push your new branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature-login

✅ Now your branch is visible on GitHub under the "Branches" tab.

Step 6: Merge the branch back into main
Switch back to main:
git checkout main

Then merge:
git merge feature-login

✅ Now main has all the changes from feature-login.

Step 7: Push the merged main branch to GitHub
git push origin main


Step 8: (Optional) Delete the feature branch
After merging:
git branch -d feature-login

and on GitHub:
git push origin --delete feature-login


🌐 3️⃣ Doing Branching and Merging on GitHub Website
👉 Create a new branch


Go to your repo on GitHub.


Click the Branch dropdown (usually shows “main”).


Type your new branch name (like feature-login) and press Enter.



👉 Make changes


Edit files directly on that branch or push commits to it from your local system.



👉 Create a Pull Request (PR)


Go to the Pull Requests tab.


Click New Pull Request.


Select base: main ← compare: feature-login.


Click Create Pull Request.


Add title & description → then click Merge Pull Request.



👉 Delete branch (optional)
After merging, GitHub will give you a “Delete branch” option.
